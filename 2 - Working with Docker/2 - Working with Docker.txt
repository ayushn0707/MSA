# Practical 2 : Working with Docker.

# Step 1:
==> Go to Docker Hub using the following URL: 
https://hub.docker.com/
==> Go to Repositories  Click on Create repository.
==> Set the name of the repository as ‘repo1’ and add some description about the repository. 
==> Set the visibility as Private.

# Step 2:
==> Go to Docker Playground using the following link: 
https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
==> Click on start & create on add new instance.

# Step 3:
==> Enter the following command :
docker --version
docker pull hello-world
docker images
docker login   # Enter Docker Hub username and password.

# Step 4:
==> Create a tag in the repository :
docker tag <image_id> <username>/<repository_name>:tag_name
==> Eg., docker tag 9c7a54a9a43c vivekn07/repo1:firsttag

==> To push the hello world image :
docker push <username>/<repository_name>:tag_name
==> Eg., docker push vivekn07/repo1:firsttag

==> Now go to Docker Hub. 
==> Under Repositories, select your repository  Go to Tags  You will see the ‘firsttag’ tag.

# Step 5:
==> Build your own image and then push it to the docker repository and run it.
==> To build a new image, use the following commands:
cat > Dockerfile << EOF
FROM busybox
cmd echo “Hello World! This is my first docker image”
EOF

==> To build this image to a new repository.
docker build -t <username>/<repository_name> .
==> Eg., docker build -t vivekn07/repo2 .

==> Push this image to Docker hub repository.
docker push <username>/<repository_name>
==> Eg., docker push vivekn07/repo2

==> Check the output on docker hub.
==> To run this image.
docker run <username>/<repository_name>
==> Eg., docker run vivekn07/repo2
